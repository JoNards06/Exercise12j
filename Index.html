        Officially known as the Republic of the Philippines, the Philippines is an archipelago nation consisting of 7,641 islands in Southeast Asia. This may sound like a daunting number of islands, but only a few islands attract visitors on a Philippines vacation. The country is generally grouped into three main collections of islands: Luzon in the north, Visayas in the centre, and Mindanao in the south.
        
        Over 100 million people live in the nation, making it one of the largest countries in the world. Manila, on the northern island of Luzon, is the nation’s capital, but the southern islands and their beaches and resorts attract most of the tourists.</p></br>
